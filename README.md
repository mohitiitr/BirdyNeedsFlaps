# BirdyNeedsFlaps

Version 1.2.0
You need to continously power(or say make fly)the bird other wise it will fall.
You can use spacebar/arrowUp key for making bird go up.
ArrowRight takes bird to right (beware!! pipes are coming).
Arrowleft takes bird to left (try not to go out of the view!! ).
ArrowDown pushes birdy down (OHH Gosh!! are you kidding? why will you use this to support gravity).
This is a web application,one of my early's (ie my starting times)based on html,js and css.


Thanks for trying my game out.
You need to open birdgame.html in  a browser to play the game ,happy flapping.
